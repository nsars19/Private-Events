# README

This is a simple event creation/subscription application. Users will be able to both create and attend events when they are signed in. Signing in only requires users to select a username.

This purpose of this project is to build upon and demonstrate my knowledge of Rails' Active Record Associations, while also further developing the foundational knowledge needed to develop complex Rails applications.
